# Benford-s-Law
Finding irregularities in voting datasets and investigating voter fraud. Program can be used on any dataset.

Benford's Law, also known as the First-Digit Law, is an empirical observation about the distribution of leading digits in many sets of numerical data. It states that in naturally occurring datasets, such as populations, financial figures, or mathematical constants, the leading digits are not uniformly distributed but instead follow a specific pattern.
